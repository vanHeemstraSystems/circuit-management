# 100 - Introduction

Use [react-plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js) to embed D3 charts in your [React](https://reactjs.org/)-powered web application. This React component takes the chart type, data, and styling as [Plotly JSON](https://help.plot.ly/json-chart-schema/?_ga=2.210506070.2137793855.1692600547-456608084.1692600545) in its data and layout props, then draws the chart using Plotly.js. See below about how to get started with react-plotly.js.
